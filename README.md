# HW4: Object Oriented Game of Life Simulation

This project is a Java implementation of Conway’s Game of Life using object oriented design principles. It includes multiple versions of the simulation, applying classic software design patterns such as **Observer** and **Singleton**.

## Features

- Modular design with clear separation of model, view, and control logic
- Observer pattern implementation for dynamic UI updates
- Singleton pattern for consistent state management
- Command pattern for user interactions
- Diagrams for architectural overview
- Eclipse project metadata included for easy setup

## File Overview

- `src/` - Java source files
- `bin/` - Compiled class files
- `stateTypes/` - Contains state definitions for cells
- `observe.drawio.png` and `command.drawio.png` - System design diagrams
- `.classpath`, `.project`, `.settings/` - Eclipse project files

## How to Run

1. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred Java IDE
2. Build the project
3. Run `Main` from the appropriate package

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ)

## Screenshots

Architecture diagrams are included in the root directory:

- `observe.drawio.png` – Observer pattern structure
- `command.drawio.png` – Command pattern overview
